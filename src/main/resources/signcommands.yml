# All commands are executed when the structure is created,
# as server/console commands (with OP permissions).
#
# The following placeholders can be used in a command:
#
# <signX>, <signY> and <signZ> - The x, y and z coordinate of the sign itself.
# <structX1>,<structY1>,<structZ1> - The x, y and z coordinates of the lower corner of the placed structure.
# <structX2>,<structY2>,<structZ2> - The x, y and z coordinates of the opposite, higher corner of the placed structure.
# <name-[type][:no][:no1-no2]> :
# <name-fantasy> - Generates a random name with the syllables and rules defined in "names/fantasy.txt", with 2 syllables
# <name-fantasy:3> - Same, but generates a name with 3 syllables
# <name-fantasy:2-4> - Same, but generates a name with 2, 3 or 4 syllabes (random value within the range of 2-4).
SignCommands:
  -
    # Alias used as reference on sign (2nd line). So for these
    # commands, create a sign in your structure with these 2 lines:
    # [command]
    # SaySomething
    alias: SaySomething
    commands:
      - "say Sign coordinate: <signX>,<signY>,<signZ>"
      - "say Structure coordinate one: <structX1>,<structY1>,<structZ1>"
      - "say Structure coordinate two: <structX2>,<structY2>,<structZ2>"
