# All commands are executed when the structure is created,
# as server/console commands (with OP permissions).
#
# The following placeholders can be used in a command:
#
# <signX>, <signY> and <signZ> - The x, y and z coordinate of the sign itself.
# <structX1>,<structY1>,<structZ1> - The x, y and z coordinates of the lower corner of the placed structure.
# <structX2>,<structY2>,<structZ2> - The x, y and z coordinates of the opposite, higher corner of the placed structure.
# <name-[type][:no][:no1-no2]> :
# <name-fantasy> - Generates a random name with the syllables and rules defined in "names/fantasy.txt", with 2 syllables
# <name-fantasy:3> - Same, but generates a name with 3 syllables
# <name-fantasy:2-4> - Same, but generates a name with 2, 3 or 4 syllabes (random value within the range of 2-4).
# <lastName> - Can only be used AFTER a the placeholder "<name-*>" was used at least once. In that case, <lastName>
#              will just return the same name again. This is useful in cases where in a series of commands the first
#              one needs to generate a new name, and the following commands need to use the same name (e.g. when creating
#              and configuring a WorldGuard region).
SignCommands:
  -
    # Alias used as reference on sign (2nd line). So for these
    # commands, create a sign in your structure with these 2 lines:
    # [command]
    # SaySomething
    alias: SaySomething
    commands:
      - "say Sign coordinate: <signX>,<signY>,<signZ>"
      - "say Structure coordinate one: <structX1>,<structY1>,<structZ1>"
      - "say Structure coordinate two: <structX2>,<structY2>,<structZ2>"
  -
    # The following command group creates a WorldGuard region, so that
    # the structure is protected and nobody can build there.
    alias: "WorldGuard"
    commands:
      # First select world and region with WorldEdit commands
      - "/world deadlyrealms"
      - "/pos1 <structX1>,<structY1>,<structZ1>"
      - "/pos2 <structX2>,<structY2>,<structZ2>"
      # Then create region with WorldGuard command
      - "rg define <uniqueName-fantasy:2-4>"
      # Allow people to open doors, use levers, buttons and trapdoors
      - "rg flag <lastName> use allow"
